# Identifying-Fraud-at-Enron

## Introduction

The goal of the Enron Case study is to analyze a dataset composed of financial and email features from Enron employees that were employed during the Enron scandal as well as other persons that did business with Enron. I will test various supervised machine learning algorithms in order to generalize patterns and be able to predict employees who may be fraudulent, indicated by the label POI â€“ person of interest.

## Final Analysis
Below is a blocks link that explains my analysis and results.
